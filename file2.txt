i am crrently reading i have a dream by rasmi bansal.
i liked the story of anand kumar super 30 the most.
then i can also relate to that courier servuce in which employees are from deaf community.
if i have not been the part of this reading bbok, i have would have never come across the different problems which physically challenged people face on daily basis.
i should be more passionate about reading books.
today i am excied to read the book with listening songs.
i have complted one section rainmakers.
